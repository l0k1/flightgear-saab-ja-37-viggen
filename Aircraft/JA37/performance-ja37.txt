Note:
-----
Some of these values, especially those which come from early sources is likely to be over/understatements, due to their classified nature at the time they were released.

Interview with pilot
====================
Minimum mach 0.9 at sealevel mil-thrust
Faster acceleration than Danish F-16A between M0.6 and M0.8.
Speed unstable below some 370 km/h. That meant that you lost speed at a very rapid rate when the alpha was increased.
The Viggen was a very manoeuvrable aircraft when reaching speeds above about 600 km/h. Less speed meant a rather lazy aircraft, especially in roll.
While flying at extreme high altitudes for the A/C envelope. You could end up in a high temperature stall, which you normally cured by shutting down the engine and restart it a few thousand meters below!

Landing:
  Landing Run approx 500 m
  Landing Speed 220 kmh
  The undercarriage is lowered.
  The thrust reverser is pre-selected to activate immediately after landing.
  The approach is steep.
  The aircraft attitude is 15 degrees nose up.
  The speed is controlled by the autopilot.
  The aircraft crosses the runway threshold at 130 knots (240 kmh).
  Touchdown with a no-flare landing at 97 knots (180 kmh).
  Touchdown is about 45 metres (150 feet) beyond the runway threshold.
  The undercarriage is designed for a landing sink rate of 16 feet/sec (5 m/s).
Takeoff:
  The aircraft was initially designed to operate from narrow 500 m long runways (1640 feet). Tha actual take-off run is
  approximately 400 metres (1310 feet). The key points in the aircraft take-off are as follows;
  Afterburner is selected then the wheel brakes are released.
  The aircraft accelerates to a rotation speed of 135 knots (250 kmh).
  About 600 metres of runway is used to get airborne.
  After lift-off the undercarriage is retracted and the aircraft accelerates at a 2 to 3 degree climb angle
  to 367 knots (680 kmh).
  Below 190 knots (350 kmh) the aircraft is very sensitive in roll.
  Afterburner is cut out at 270 knots (500 kmh) due primarily to noise abatement requirements.
  Exceeding 30 degrees angle of attack results in some loss of yaw stability.
  Over 30 degrees AOA the aircraft will enter into a "super stall", but is easily recoverable.
  There is little natural pre-stall warning, with low buffet levels.

======================
0.63 lbm/hr/lbf consumption for cruise speeds.
Fuel consumption was rated 18 mg/N/s dry and 71 mg/N/s with afterburner.
The Viggen's consumption was around 15 kg/sec at maximum afterburner
Internal fuel was exhausted in just 7 minutes at full afterburner.

===========================================
Although designed to withstand 12 G, the operational limit is 7 G.
The seat is angled back 19 degrees.
The landing gear thinks a landing sink rate of 5 m/s is normal, so landings are done without any flare;
